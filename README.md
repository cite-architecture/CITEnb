# CITE notebooks

This repository contains [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) illustrating ways to work with citable scholarly resources.  Jupyter notebooks are composed of cells ("paragraphs") that can contain either text structured with [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), or code in one of a number of languages that can be automatically executed.  For scholars working with digital resources, notebook systems like Jupyter break down the artifical and noxious separation of text and code.

The illustrative examples in this repository are thoroughly documented, and can serve as starting points for similar or further work.  The code is written in Scala, using libraries from the [CITE architecture](http://cite-architecture.github.io/).

## Prerequisites

Since github executes Jupyter notebooks and displays the results, you can study the examples just by browsing the repository's `.ipynb` files with a web browser.

To run the examples interactively, you need to run a Jupyter notebook system with a Scala kernel installed.  (Here is an [easy way to do that](https://github.com/alexarchambault/jupyter-scala).)
